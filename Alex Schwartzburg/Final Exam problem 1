#Fix this expression without changing any numbers,so x evaluates to 28:
x = 7 * 2  **2


# While the answer may APPEAR TO BE to do nothing, 
# as x will evaluate to 28 anyway, this only occurs
# because 2x2 = 2^2 = 4.
# For the majority of numbers, however, it would
# be necessary to eliminate one of the asterisks from the double asterisk
# to obtain
# x = 7 * 2 * 2, 
# because ** means exponentiation in python. 
#Also, the expression was indented.  So I needed to de-indent it.
#The corrected expression appears in my code on the next line.""")

x = 7 * 2 * 2
