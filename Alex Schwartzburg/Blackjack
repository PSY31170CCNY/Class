#The blackjack assignment is there to allow you to take several smaller
#programming problems and connect them into a larger program:

#√ 1    Create the deck: use python lists and strings to create the list of
#       cards programmatically with a loop inside a loop (as opposed to typing
#       the literal 52 cards by hand) using the example code in blackjack.py.
#√  2     Deal the cards: use a loop within which each hand is dealt, and an
#       inner loop that deals a hand to the player, with a conditional that
#        decides whether to deal another card or end the inner loop.
#  3   Tally the score: the final tallying of the score of each hand
#       requires a bit of logic to process multiple Aces, but that is spelled
#       out in detail in the assignment.
#    RUNNING INTO TROUBLE WITH 3.
