For the final project I decided to view the available data on the OpenData website on 
drinking fountains in New York Cit parks. 
To do so, I went to NYC Open Data and found something that would be interesting to consider: 
Drinking Fountains.
At https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Drinking-Fountains/ph76-k6qa
I was able to download a CSV for Excel file that listed location, names, details and the amount of 
drinking fountains available at the site. 
By implementing Python, several doors open that may let us organize data from spreadsheets and 
paste them upon documents. 
For example, one question one might want to know about fountains in NYC parks is, 
"Which borough has the most amount of park water fountains?"
